This is my final project for operating systems. The assignment was to use some sort of os functionailty within our project. 
My original goal was to use socket programming and have the application be multiplayer. However I ran into issues with using two emulators. 
Both instances were unable to see each other and after port forwarding, trying to get a client and server to host on the same instance was diffcult.

<h2> :floppy_disk: Installation </h2>
<li> Clone or download the repository</li>
<li>Open Andriod Studio or your preferred emulator</li>
<li> Run! </li>

<h3>:pencil: Usage </h3>
Playing is really easy! <br> Just hit single player and enter some words into the dictionary. As you play more the dictionary will grow.
The more you play the harder the game becomes. <br> :warning: Warning: The multiplayer function does not work as 4/26/2019.
